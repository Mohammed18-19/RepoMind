### AI Codebase Intelligence System powered by RAG

**RepoMind** is an AI-powered codebase intelligence system that allows developers to understand unfamiliar software repositories through natural-language questions.

Instead of sending an entire repository to an LLM, RepoMind builds a retrieval pipeline specifically designed for source code:

**Repository → Code-aware chunks → Embeddings → Hybrid retrieval → Reranking → Grounded generation → Source citations**

The goal is simple:

> **Give developers accurate, traceable answers about a codebase without relying on the LLM to guess.**

---

## ✨ Why RepoMind?

Large language models are good at reasoning about code, but giving an LLM an entire repository creates several problems:

* Context windows are limited.
* Relevant files may be buried among hundreds of irrelevant ones.
* Exact identifiers and function names are difficult to retrieve using semantic search alone.
* Large contexts increase latency and cost.
* Generated answers can contain unsupported claims.
* Developers need to know **where an answer came from**.

RepoMind addresses these problems with a retrieval-first architecture combining:

* AST-based code-aware chunking
* Dense vector search
* Keyword search
* Hybrid retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
* Cross-encoder reranking
* Context construction with file and line metadata
* Grounded LLM generation
* Source citations
* Conversation history
* Retrieval evaluation

# 🔍 Core Retrieval Pipeline

RepoMind is not simply "an LLM connected to a vector database."

The retrieval pipeline contains several stages, each solving a different problem.

### 1. Repository ingestion

Repositories can be loaded from:

* GitHub URLs
* ZIP archives

The loader creates an isolated temporary workspace before processing the repository.

---

### 2. File discovery and filtering

The ingestion layer scans the repository and filters irrelevant content such as:

* `.git`
* virtual environments
* `node_modules`
* build directories
* generated artifacts
* binary/media files
* archives

This prevents irrelevant data from entering the retrieval index.

---

### 3. Code-aware chunking

Instead of blindly splitting source files by character count, RepoMind uses Python's AST to identify top-level code structures such as:

* imports
* functions
* classes

Each chunk keeps metadata including:

```text
file path
filename
language
start line
end line
content
```

This makes retrieved results easier to understand and allows generated answers to reference the original source location.

---

### 4. Embeddings

Each code chunk is converted into a vector representation using:

**`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`**

Embedding dimension:

```text
768
```

The vectors are stored directly in PostgreSQL through `pgvector`.

---

# 🗄️ PostgreSQL + pgvector

RepoMind uses PostgreSQL as the primary persistence layer.

`pgvector` provides vector storage and similarity search directly inside PostgreSQL.

The system also uses **HNSW** indexing for efficient approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval.

Conceptually:

```text
Repository
   │
   ├── Files
   │      │
   │      └── Chunks
   │              │
   │              └── 768-dimensional embedding
   │
   └── Conversations
           │
           └── Messages
```

This keeps repository metadata, source chunks, embeddings, and conversation history in one database system.

---

# 🔎 Hybrid Retrieval

Semantic search alone is not enough for code.

For example, a query such as:

```text
Where is `ConversationManager` instantiated?
```

contains an exact identifier that keyword matching can retrieve extremely well.

On the other hand:

```text
How does RepoMind remember previous questions?
```

is more semantic and benefits from vector search.

RepoMind therefore combines two retrieval strategies.

### Semantic Search

Uses embedding similarity to find conceptually relevant code.

Useful for questions such as:

```text
How does conversation history work?
```

### Keyword Search

Finds exact lexical matches.

Useful for:

```text
Where is RAGPipeline created?
```

### Hybrid Search

The results from both retrieval methods are combined using:

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**

This produces a ranking that benefits from both:

```text
semantic understanding
        +
exact code matching
        ↓
better retrieval
```

---

# 🎯 Reranking

Initial retrieval is optimized for recall.

RepoMind then applies a second-stage **cross-encoder reranker** to improve the ordering of the retrieved candidates.

The pipeline becomes:

```text
Query
  ↓
Semantic Search ──┐
                  ├──→ RRF → Candidate Results
Keyword Search ───┘
                         ↓
                     Reranker
                         ↓
                 Top Relevant Context
```

This separates:

* **candidate retrieval**
* **relevance scoring**

instead of relying on a single retrieval mechanism.

---

# 🧠 Grounded Generation

After retrieval, RepoMind constructs a structured context containing the selected source chunks.

Example:

```text
--- Source 1 ---
File: app/ingestion/rag/pipeline.py
Lines: 42-67

<retrieved source code>
```

The LLM receives this retrieved context and is instructed to:

* answer using repository evidence
* avoid inventing files or functions
* clearly state when the available context is insufficient
* provide source citations for repository-based claims

The result is a **grounded answer rather than an unrestricted LLM response**.

---

# 📌 Source Citations

Repository answers include source information such as:

```text
src/main.py:1-1
```

This gives the developer a way to trace an answer back to the original code.

The citation pipeline is:

```text
Retrieved Chunk
      ↓
File Path + Line Range
      ↓
Context Builder
      ↓
LLM
      ↓
Grounded Answer
      ↓
Source Citation
```

Traceability is a core design goal of RepoMind.

---

# 💬 Conversation History

RepoMind also persists conversations and messages.

This allows follow-up questions to use previous conversational context.

For example:

```text
User:
How is authentication implemented?

RepoMind:
...

User:
Where is that logic called?

RepoMind:
...
```

The conversation layer provides context without treating conversation history as a substitute for repository retrieval.

Repository facts still need to come from retrieved repository context.

---

# 📊 Evaluation

RepoMind includes a labeled retrieval evaluation set containing **30 queries**.

Current evaluation result:

| Metric             |    Result |
| ------------------ | --------: |
| Correct retrievals |   26 / 30 |
| Retrieval accuracy | **86.7%** |

The evaluation was used to iterate on:

* retrieval strategy
* query routing
* hybrid search
* ranking behavior

The purpose is not to claim perfect retrieval, but to have a measurable way to identify retrieval failures.

---

# 🌐 REST API

RepoMind exposes a lightweight Flask API.

### Health

```http
GET /health
```

Returns the service status.

### Create repository

```http
POST /repositories
```

Ingests a repository and creates its database representation.

### Create conversation

```http
POST /conversations
```

Creates a persistent conversation.

### Ask a question

```http
POST /chat
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "repository_id": 1,
  "conversation_id": 1,
  "question": "How does hybrid retrieval work?"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "answer": "...",
  "repository_id": 1
}
```

---

# 🧪 Testing

RepoMind includes API tests covering:

* health checks
* validation errors
* repository creation
* successful chat requests
* invalid conversation handling
* missing required fields

Current test result:

```text
7 passed
```

The project is also checked with Python compilation:

```bash
python -m compileall -q app
```

And whitespace / patch validation:

```bash
git diff --check
```

# 🎯 Design Goals

RepoMind was built around several principles.

### Retrieval before generation

The LLM should reason over retrieved evidence rather than receive an uncontrolled repository dump.

### Code-aware data representation

Source code has structure. The retrieval system should preserve that structure instead of treating everything as plain text.

### Hybrid retrieval

Semantic similarity and exact identifier matching solve different problems. Code search benefits from both.

### Reranking

Initial retrieval should prioritize recall, while reranking improves the quality of the final context.

### Grounded answers

The model should answer from repository evidence and explicitly acknowledge when the evidence is insufficient.

### Traceability

Answers should point developers back to the source code that supports them.

### Measurability

Retrieval quality should be evaluated instead of assumed.

### Simplicity

RepoMind intentionally avoids unnecessary infrastructure and focuses on the core code intelligence pipeline.

---

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

RepoMind is a portfolio-focused engineering project rather than a full commercial developer platform.

Current limitations include:

* The code-aware chunker currently focuses on top-level AST structures.
* Retrieval evaluation is based on a relatively small labeled dataset.
* The API does not currently include authentication or authorization.
* The system is not designed for distributed production-scale workloads.
* There is no dedicated frontend application.
* Repository ingestion is currently designed around the supported ingestion workflow rather than continuous synchronization.

These are deliberate boundaries rather than hidden assumptions.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Possible future directions include:

* More advanced code-aware chunking
* Larger evaluation datasets
* Additional programming-language parsers
* Improved retrieval evaluation metrics
* Repository synchronization
* Authentication and authorization
* Dedicated web interface
* Production deployment
* Observability and monitoring
* More advanced codebase reasoning

These are intentionally outside the current core scope.

---

# 🔐 Security & Configuration

Secrets should never be committed to the repository.

RepoMind uses:

```text
.env
```

for local configuration and provides:

```text
.env.example
```

with safe placeholders.

The real `.env` file is excluded from version control.

# 🧩 Engineering Takeaway

The central idea behind RepoMind is not simply:

> "Connect an LLM to a vector database."

It is:

> **Design a retrieval system that can identify the right pieces of a codebase, rank them effectively, preserve their source information, and provide that evidence to an LLM in a controlled way.**

That distinction is what makes RepoMind a **codebase intelligence system** rather than a basic chatbot.
